Problem: 
Always forgetting about how I do things, example, I can never remeber how bash flags work

Reasons: 
I can find slutions easier and locally, without searching for a website that I may not have bookmarked

How I would like it to work:

Adding a new snippet or concept
geat new-folder <FOLDER>
geat new-snippet <FOLDER>
Title: 
Content:
Alias: 

Retrieving a snippet or concept
geat ls <FOLDER>
geat get <SNIPPET_TITLE OR ALIAS>
